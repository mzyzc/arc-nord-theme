# Arc Theme

Arc is a flat theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and various desktop shells, window managers and applications. It's well suited for GTK based desktop environments such as GNOME, Cinnamon, Xfce, Unity, MATE, Budgie etc.

The theme was originally designed and developed by [horst3180](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), but the project has been unmaintained since May 2017.

This fork aims to keep the theme updated with new toolkit and desktop environment versions, resolve pre-existing issues, and improve and polish the theme while preserving the original visual design.

## Arc is available in four variants
